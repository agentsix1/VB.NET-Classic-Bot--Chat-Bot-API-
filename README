This is a project I am not sure quite yet how far it is gonna go. How ever this is the visual look I have in place for it. If you would like to give me your input please do. You can download the current release (Source Release) at https://arcticworlds.net/spigot/download/VB.NET_Classic_Bot_(Chat_Bot_API).exe

Q: Why Webbrowsers?
A: So I wanted to make this fairly simple to use. I figured the best way to do that was just use a web browser and just modify that.

Q: Why VB.NET?
A: Why not....

Q: Are you going to finish this project?
A: Maybe? I may or may not. How ever this is a good starting platfor for this project. If all else fails people can use it and modify it to their pleasure.

Q: Why open source?
A: Honestly I feel that most if not all programs should be open source now days.

Q: Can I Rerelease your program and say I created it?
A: Well.... Yea you can. How ever I would prefer you didn't. The work I have put into this should be respected and at least given credit. How ever I am not going to stop you.

Q: Do I take request/ideas?
A: Totally! Give me any ideas or request and I will give you feed back on what I think.

Q: What are your current plans?
A: Getting a working product that can connect to the bnet main frame and work my way from there.

If you have any further questions make a post in issues with the title "[QUESTION] Title" I will do my best to get back to you!
